How YOU can help with Dr. Turk...

Dr. Turk is a crowdsourced advice column. People can post to the website about advice that they need, and a crowd-generated response will be emailed to you!

We bought a domain name for our website. Legit, we know. 
Please first post your question to doctorturk.co

Now that you've asked your question, it's time to be a part of the crowd that produces the response! On MTurk, search "advice", "nets213", "doctorturk" or "jawn". If there are any hits available, ours will be one of the only ones there, and the requester is "Leeland Criso". If there are no hits available at the moment, please come back again later! Once you're at the hit, a question will be asked, and we would like you to give the most detailed and genuine response you are capable of. A monetary bonus will be given to the answer that the crowd votes as the best answer.

Lastly, we need to do some quality control to make sure that these responses are legit. Please complete some hits in ranking collected responses. On MTurk, search "quality", "ranking", "response", "nets213" or "doctorturk". If there are any hits available, ours will be one of the only ones there, and the requester is "Leeland Criso". If there are no hits available at the moment, please come back again later! Once you're at the hit, please rank the responses.
